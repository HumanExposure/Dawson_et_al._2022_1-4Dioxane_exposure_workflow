# Dawson_et_al._2022_1-4Dioxane_exposure_workflow 
This is a workflow developed to estimate exposure to, and mass released down the drain of 1,4-Dioxane from two, non-occupational pathways: contaminated drinking water and the use of consumer products contamianted with 1,4-Dioxane through ethoxylated ingredients. The workflow is open source, and incorporates USEPA's Stochastic Human Exposure Dose Simulator High Throughput (SHEDS-HT).
